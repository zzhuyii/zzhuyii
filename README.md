Iâ€™m currently a Postdoc Research Fellow in Department of Mechanical Engineering and in Departmetn of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Michigan. 

My primary research focus is on the simulation, design, and fabrication of origami-inspired functional structures. 

My GitHub wbspace is for publishing codes I wrote for computational origami, including packages for simulation and inverse-design of functional origami structures with multi-physical behaviors.
