I’m currently a PhD candidate in Civil Engineering and Scientific Computation at University of Michigan. 

I am currently working on the simulation, design, and fabrication of origami-inspired active structures. 

More specifically, I have been working on a multi-physics based simulation framework for active 
origami and the associated simulation package is made publically available here at GitHub.
